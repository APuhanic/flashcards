# Flashcards Web App

This is a web application built using React and React Bootstrap that allows users to create flashcards, organize them into decks, and study them. Users can log in, create their own decks, add study cards to each deck, and then evaluate their understanding of the cards using a rating scale of 1-5.

## Features

- User Registration and Login: Users can create an account and log in to the application.
- Deck Management: Users can create, edit, and delete decks to organize their flashcards.
- Flashcard Creation: Users can create study cards within each deck, providing a front and back side for each card.
- Study Mode: Users can enter study mode for a specific deck and go through their flashcards one by one, flipping them to reveal the answer.
- Self-Evaluation: After reviewing each flashcard, users can rate their understanding of the card using a scale of 1-5.
- Progress Tracking: The application keeps track of the user's progress by recording the ratings given to each flashcard, helping users identify areas that require further review.
